## Overview

The goal was to create an employee directory with Reactjs. This assignment required the application's UI to be broken up into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. This was my first Reactjs application.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
