## Overview

The goal was to create an employee directory with Reactjs. This assignment required the application's UI to be broken up into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. This was my first Reactjs application.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Functionality

When landing on the main page there is a list of the employees. The user can filter the employees by job title or sort by age.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Running Application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
